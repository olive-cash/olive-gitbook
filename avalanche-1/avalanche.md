**üîêSafety and Audit**

We chose to fork Pancakes‚Äôs contracts for our base protocol since they have stood the test of time. This will allow our users to interpret the integrity/security of our protocol easily. Simply compare our deployed contracts with Pancakes‚Äôs repository so anyone with an understanding of solidity will be able to look through the code, compare Pancakes and OliveSwap side-by-side, and conclude that OliveSwap is safe.
