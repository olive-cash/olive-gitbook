Plan is to have a natural grow by building good product and making few partnership with other BSC and AVAX projects. We dont really want to just spam this group everywhere

**Where Timelock?**  
Hey guys regarding timelock! We didn't introduce one yet, because we gonna add new farms regularly. There is no any ruggable function in contract, you can review by yourself. No migrator, no tokenPerBlock change, not even a Syrup bug. Nothing that can rug you, so no worries about that. If you find any reason to add timelock, we will add it for you.

**When bridge?**  
Yes, we planned to build a bridge between two chains \(BSC&lt;&gt;Avalanche\) on the first day of the project. But now move implementation of bridge to one month. Cause we can't mint Olive tokens in both chains and we have to motivate our Olive holder to take part in liquidity providing for special Bridge Pool.
