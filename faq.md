**Give me your money and I teach you marketing \(spam, shilling, etc\)**  
Plan is to have a natural grow by building good product and making few partnership with other BSC and AVAX projects. We dont really want to just spam this group everywhere

**Why OliveSwap is better or have any value added against other DEX?**  
We really enjoy the DeFi movement. We studied a lot of projects in ETH/BSC/Avax chains since 2017. And we build our own solid infrastructure with the Mixture of Best Practice and Solutions.   
- we  are going to pay many Olives for those who provide liquidity via OliveSwap \(APR is the biggest on Avalanche\)  
- we are great developers, and deliver more features than others DEXes.  
  
**Where Timelock?**  
Hey guys regarding timelock! We didn't introduce one yet, because we gonna add new farms regularly. There is no any ruggable function in contract, you can review by yourself. No migrator, no tokenPerBlock change, not even a Syrup bug. Nothing that can rug you, so no worries about that. If you find any reason to add timelock, we will add it for you.

**When burn?**   
We are working on implementation of the Olive Fire Show. Check our Roadmap!   
  
**When rug?**  
Why rug with we can build amazing things, working on this project really drive us.  
  
**When audit?**  
Our code is audited by many community devs, and verified by time. We can discuss with you any line of code \(check our repo\)  
  
**When bridge?**  
Yes, we planned to build a bridge between two chains \(BSC&lt;&gt;Avalanche\) on the first day of the project. But now move implementation of bridge to one month. Cause we can't mint Olive tokens in both chains and we have to motivate our Olive holder to take part in liquidity providing for special Bridge Pool.  
  
**Why did olive cash stop showing price on trust wallet?**  
TrustWallet shows Olive price when it has 100k Trading Volume.
