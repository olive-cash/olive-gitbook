# Olive Garden

[Olive Garden](https://avax.olive.cash/pools) ****Pools allow Avalanche chain projects to bootstrap adoption by distributing a portion of their tokens to OLIVE token holders.

Olive.Garden Pool is split into two sections: Core and Community.

* Core will be initially selected by the Olive.Cash team.
* Community will be projects that pass a community vote on social networks.

Note that any project will be able to distribute tokens via Olive.Garden Pool, but only projects that win a vote would be listed on the swap interface as a default option \(in order to discourage scams\).

**Why would projects want to participate?**

Since Olive.Cash has had [the launch on Avalanche](https://olive-cash.medium.com/Ð°nother-step-towards-moon-afeca5128022), Olive.Garden Pool projects will allow projects to receive market attention by issuing tokens to the big and active Avalanche community.

Projects will also receive an immediate default listing on the Olive.Cash interface, obtaining priority promotion on the exchange \(by ranking temporarily first in selecting tokens on the website\).
